One-hot encoding is a natural way to represent class labels in a classification task since a neural network outputs a class probability vector. `[0,0,0,1,0]` then simply corresponds to a 0% chance of the sample belonging the classes `1,2,3,5` and a 100% chance of it belonging to class `4`."

If you look at the loss graph you'll see that the network initially learns quickly, i.e. the loss rapidly decreases, but learning slows down far before reaching 100% accuracy. Since the network parameters are updated by gradient descent, slow learning simply means that the gradients have become small.
